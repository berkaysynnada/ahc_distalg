Introduction
============


In the landscape of distributed computing, the challenge of efficiently traversing a network to ensure that each node is visited precisely once is paramount. This problem is crucial for a wide range of applications, from routing algorithms to network diagnostics and maintenance. Solving this problem enables more efficient use of network resources, improved fault tolerance, and enhanced performance in distributed systems.

The significance of this challenge lies not only in its direct implications for network efficiency and reliability but also in its role in optimizing distributed algorithms and protocols. When we can guarantee efficient and complete network traversal, we enable distributed systems to achieve better synchronization, resource allocation, and data consistency. Conversely, failing to address this issue can lead to incomplete network coverage, inefficient resource use, and potential vulnerabilities in network security and integrity.

However, achieving an efficient traversal in a distributed system is inherently difficult due to the system's decentralized nature and the lack of global knowledge at each node. Naive approaches might overlook the complexities of network topology, node availability, and communication delays, leading to suboptimal traversal strategies that either miss nodes or visit them multiple times, thereby wasting resources.

Historically, several algorithms have been proposed to tackle network traversal, yet many fall short in distributed environments. Traditional depth-first or breadth-first search algorithms, for instance, assume a level of centralized control or global knowledge that is unrealistic in distributed settings. Others, like random walks, may eventually cover the entire network but lack efficiency and predictability. The Tarry Algorithm distinguishes itself by offering a systematic approach to distributed network traversal without requiring central coordination or prior knowledge of the network's topology, addressing the limitations of previous solutions.

Our approach revolves around implementing and analyzing the Tarry Algorithm, known for its methodical exploration of networks using a depth-first search paradigm, adapted for distributed systems. The algorithm's key components include token passing for initiating and tracking traversal, a rule-based mechanism for choosing the next node to visit, and a backtracking strategy to ensure all nodes are covered efficiently. While effective, this algorithm also presents limitations, particularly in terms of traversal time and the overhead of token passing in dense or large networks.

Our report aims to contribute the following:

- A detailed implementation of the Tarry Algorithm in a simulated distributed network environment, illustrating its operation and efficiency.
- An analysis of the algorithm's performance, highlighting its strengths and limitations in various network topologies and conditions.
- Insights into potential improvements and adaptations of the Tarry Algorithm to enhance its applicability and efficiency in modern distributed systems.
